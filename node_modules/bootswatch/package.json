  "readme": "Bootswatch\n==========\n\n[![Bootswatch Logo](https://bootswatch.com/_assets/img/logo-dark.png)](https://bootswatch.com)\n\nBootswatch is a collection of open source themes for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Check it out at [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com).\n\nUsage\n-----\nDownload the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme and replace Bootstrap's default stylesheet. You must still include Bootstrap's JavaScript file to have functional dropdowns, modals, etc.\n\nYou can install as a package via npm with the command `npm install bootswatch`.\n\nYou can also hotlink the themes via CDN at [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/). \n\nLastly, you can import a theme into your styles using SASS.\n\n\n```sass\n@import \"bootswatch/theme/variables\";\n@import \"bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";\n@import \"bootswatch/theme/bootswatch\";\n\n```\n\n\nCustomization\n------\nBootswatch is open source and youâ€™re welcome to modify the themes.\n\nEach theme consists of two SASS files. `_variables.scss`, which is included by default in Bootstrap, allows you to customize the settings. `_bootswatch.scss` introduces more extensive structural changes.\n\nCheck out the [Help page](https://bootswatch.com/help/#customization) for more details on building your own theme.\n\nAPI\n-----\n\nA simple API is available for integrating your platform with Bootswatch. More info can be found on the [Help page](https://bootswatch.com/help/#api).\n\nContributing\n-----\nIt's through your contributions that Bootswatch will continue to improve. You can contribute in several ways.\n\n**Issues:** Provide a detailed report of any bugs you encounter and open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/issues).\n\n**Documentation:** If you'd like to fix a typo or beef up the docs, you can fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.\n\n**Code:** Make a fix and submit it as a pull request. When making changes, it's important to keep the CSS and SASS versions in sync. To do this, be sure to edit the SASS source files for the particular theme first, then run the  tasks `grunt swatch` to build the CSS.\n\n**Donation:** Donations are gratefully accepted via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=F22JEM3Q78JC2) and Bitcoin at [1EMqwwjqJrfyoPqmxNM7buzU6DmySZnHBK](bitcoin:1EMqwwjqJrfyoPqmxNM7buzU6DmySZnHBK).\n\nAuthor\n------\nThomas Park\n\n+ https://github.com/thomaspark\n+ https://thomaspark.co\n\nThanks\n------\n[Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](https://github.com/fat) for [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).\n\n[Jenil Gogari](http://www.jgog.in/) for his contributions to the Flatly theme.\n\n[James Taylor](https://github.com/jostylr) for [cors-lite](https://github.com/jostylr/cors-lite).\n\n[Corey Sewell](https://github.com/cjsewell) for SASS conversion.\n\n\nCopyright and License\n----\nCopyright 2014-2017 Thomas Park\n\nCode released under the MIT License.\n",
